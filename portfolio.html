                <p class="biographyp">
                    I'm Justine Lawrence Coronel, born on February 14, 2004, and currently living in Dasmariñas, Cavite.  
                    I attended Dr. Jose P. Rizal Elementary School for my primary education and DIHS for high school.  
                
                    I have always loved playing games, especially video games. My father introduced me to my first-ever 
                    gaming console, the Nintendo Color, when I was a child. At that time, he was a buyer and seller of electronic 
                    components, and he later bought me my second console, the PlayStation. Since I didn't have many friends then 
                    and spent most of my time indoors, gaming became my favorite pastime.  
                
                    As I grew older, my passion for gaming continued, leading me to develop an interest in online and computer games. 
                    Eventually, I made a lot of friends, especially in a computer shop near our house, where we spent hours playing together. 
                    Those moments were some of the best times of my life—playing with friends was far more enjoyable than playing alone.  
                
                    Then suddenly, the pandemic began, and I lost touch with my friends for a long time. During that period, I discovered 
                    a love for books and spent most of my time reading, watching anime series, and studying Japanese and Korean culture 
                    and literature.  
                
                    Currently, I am studying under the ICT strand at Emilio Aguinaldo College Cavite (EACC). Adapting to the online learning 
                    system was challenging, but I never let it discourage me from pursuing my dreams of becoming an electronics engineer. 
                    Just like my father, I enjoy fixing and building electronic components, which is why pursuing a degree in Computer Science 
                    in college feels like a natural path for me.  
                
                    But for now, I am focusing on enjoying the last years of my teenage life while continuing to work towards my dreams.
